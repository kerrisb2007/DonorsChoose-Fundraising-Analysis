# DonorsChoose-Fundraising-Analysis
Context: Founded in 2020 in New York City, DonorsChoose is a non-profit organization with a website platform for public school teachers in the United States to post requests for classroom resources. DonorsChoose is committed to combating racial and socioeconomic inequity in school funding by empowering teachers with projects in underrepresented, low-income communities. 

The code included in this repository was used to explore data that was collected between 2012 and 2018 to provide an overview of the impact of donor projects posted online. Each dataset was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/perkymaster/school-donation-analysis/notebook

Takeways from the analysis: 
1) Months with greatest activity in terms of donations received & projects created are August and September
2) The top 10 donor states are in the most populated states in the US
3) Top 10 cities that requested donors are in areas that experienced rapid growth in ethnic diversity amongst youth
4) Research suggests that participating urban schools are in low-income areas
